# Welcome to my Allotment Andy github profile

I am available and looking for work moving into a more Devops environment. I started a blog back in June and you can read more about what I have been learning and doing.

- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/laravel">Laravel,</a> a fabulous PHP framework which i have been working with since version 4.2 
- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/bash">Bash,</a> the shell scripting and tool for command line computing 
- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/debian">Debian,</a> my favourite Linux distribution.
- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/devops">Devops,</a> posts about using linux in the new 'devops' world where the geeks, developers, designers and systems people all meet
- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/jigsaw">Jigsaw,</a> the static site generator that i use for this blog, uses Laravel Blade templating
- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/markdown">Markdown,</a> the templating language for the Jigsaw site and Readme files.
- <a href="http://allotmentandy.github.io/blog/categories/tailwindcss">Tailwind CSS,</a> a great CSS framework which uses Laravel Mix and Webpack to provide an inline CSS framework. 

My ideal job would be to work in a combination of all these areas.
